# Calendar

Hello and welcome to my Calendar project.

My Calendar project is build from scratch and written in vanilla JavaScript code.

I have included all files now, unlike in my Calculator project, so you can check entire code and workflow.<br>
Since my workflow is a little bit different the main files of this project are:<br>

index.html,<br>
script.js (concat, babel, terser),<br> 
style.css (autoprefixer, cssnano)<br> 

The 'calendar.js' and/if any other except 'script-concat.js' and 'script.js' are just script files in which I work like modules. (in this project, only this one).<br>
The 'script-concat.js' file is file which contains all script files concatenated together except himself and main one 'script.js'.<br>
The 'style-scss.css' file is a file where all my scss files are put together using 'gulp-sass'.
